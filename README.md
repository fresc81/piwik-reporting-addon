The Piwik Reporting Tool is an web extension for modern browsers (will be tested on Firefox and Chrome).
The main purpose is to provide fancy segmented statistic reports in PDF format which is not available by default in Piwik.
It also shows Piwik tracking analysis summary for the current tab, if available.

This tool is still under construction. However your feature requests and contributions are welcome.
